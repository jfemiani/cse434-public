    "In Generative AI, many models (especially in OpenAI) are closed-source. Meaning, the training data, hyperparameters, and weights that were used to create these models are not accessible to the public. Thus, the only way we have the availability to use them is through an API. While many open-source models exist, OpenAI has become the most accessible in terms of approachability, shifting the utilization of AI from Machine Learning engineers to front-end web developers (hence, a lower-level entry point).\n",
