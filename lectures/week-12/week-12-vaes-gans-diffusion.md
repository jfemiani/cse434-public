# Week 12 - Generative Methods for Images (VAES, GANS, Diffusion)


## Slides:
- I gottem, patience. No time to dig up link before pushing this up. 

## Demos
- Due to internat issue, I did them in colab. I have also uploaded but will likely demo off of the colab versions

- **Colab Version:**
    - [VAE Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ybvm-yyW6y2JW1AK3Gyywh3vzpWSDOLu)
    - [GAN Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dU2DGpZ4jge6xjTcSSgNBh15VQvAI3Cl)
- **Gitlab Version:**
    - [VAE Demo](CSE434_Generative_AI_Images_VAE.ipynb)
    - [GAN Demo](CSE434_Generative_AI_Image_Generation_GAN_Demo.ipynb)
